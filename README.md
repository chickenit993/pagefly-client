#### Technologies

With the ground rules out of the way, let's talk about the coarse architecture of this mono repo:

- **Full-stack JavaScript**: We use Node.js to power our servers, and React to power our client apps. Almost all of the code you'll touch in this codebase will be JavaScript & TypeScript.
- **Background Jobs**: 

Here is a list of all the big technologies we use:

- **MongoDB**: Data storage
- **GraphQL**: API, powered by the entire Apollo toolchain
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **React**: Frontend and mobile apps
...

#### Folder structure

#### Naming Scheme


#### Code Style
ESLint with `react-app` rules and TSLint with `awesome-typescript-loader` rules

If you use Webstorm, please navigate to `Preferences` => `TSLint` and locate the `tslint.json` file in `node_modules/awesome-typescript-loader`, we will use it by default.
